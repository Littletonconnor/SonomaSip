# Sonoma Sip — Engineering TODO

**Purpose:** Technical implementation tracker. Product intent & policies: **[`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)**. Matching math: **[`docs/SCORING.md`](docs/SCORING.md)**.

> **UI WORK RULE:** Always invoke the `/ui` skill when building or modifying any page, component, or visual element.

## Next Up (quick wins — phone-friendly)

Pick these off one at a time. Each is scoped to 1-2 file touches and should be doable in under 15 minutes.

### 1. OG image for plan pages (est. 5 min) ✅

**Goal:** Make shared `/plan/[id]` URLs render a rich preview card instead of raw URL text.

**Status:** `src/app/plan/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx` already exists and uses Next.js's App Router convention — Next auto-picks it up as `og:image`. But the `generateMetadata` in `src/app/plan/[id]/page.tsx` explicitly sets `openGraph` **without** an `images` key, which **may override** the convention file.

**Plan:**
- [x] Open `src/app/plan/[id]/page.tsx` and find `generateMetadata` (around line 64).
- [x] Explicitly reference the convention image route (`/plan/${id}/opengraph-image`) in both `openGraph.images` and `twitter.images` so the image is guaranteed to be attached regardless of Next's auto-merge behavior.
- [x] Test: run `pnpm dev`, open a plan URL, paste into [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/). You should see the generated image.

### 2. Winery detail — left-align centered text on mobile (est. 5 min) ✅

**Goal:** Two `<p>` elements on the winery detail page are incorrectly centered. Should match the left-aligned content flow of the rest of the page.

**Files to edit:** `src/app/wineries/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Plan:**
- [x] Line 277: price-per-flight line — removed `text-center` so it defaults to left.
- [x] Line 280: disclaimer line — removed `text-center` so it defaults to left.
- [x] Chose left-aligned everywhere (not `sm:text-center`) to match the surrounding left-aligned sidebar content (name, tagline, star rating).
- [x] Verify in browser at 375px width.

### 3. Results page — bottom border-radius clipping on mobile (est. 10 min) ✅

**Goal:** The bottom corners of the results card/container render flat on mobile. Needs an `overflow` + `border-radius` fix.

**Plan:**
- [x] Traced the clipping to `src/components/map/map-section.tsx`: the mobile path wraps `SonomaMap` in a `motion.div` with `overflow-hidden` (for the height animation) but no `rounded-*`. `SonomaMap` has `rounded-2xl` on its root, so the parent's overflow-hidden was clipping the child's rounded corners to flat.
- [x] Added `rounded-2xl` to the `motion.div`'s className so the clipping shape matches the child's rounding.
- [x] Verify at 375px and 768px.

(Note: the results page itself has no rounded card — the visible "card" is the map, which is shared between `/results` and `/plan/[id]` via `MapSection`, so this also fixes the same issue on the shared plan page on mobile.)

## Up Next

### Pipeline Simplification — Discovery Writes Directly to Wineries

Move from "editorial CSV import + OSM shadow registry" to a single pipeline that dynamically discovers, crawls, enriches, and publishes — all writing directly to `wineries`. Admin UI handles delete + manual fill-in for fields OSM/Firecrawl/Places can't supply (flights, varietals, style scores, editorial content, AVA assignment).

**Scope decisions locked in:**
- Matching engine + all scoring columns stay. Mapper at `src/lib/mappers.ts:57-65` already defaults null `style_*` to 3, and `scoreRating` handles null quality/popularity/rating gracefully — so sparse discovery rows rank middle-of-the-pack until admin fills them in.
- **Keep the existing 68 wineries.** Discovery upserts new OSM rows alongside them; editorial data is preserved.
- **Make currently-NOT-NULL editorial columns nullable** so OSM can insert minimal rows. Admin assigns the rest via the editor.
- **No auto-extraction of flights or varietals.** Admin enters those manually for new discoveries; the 68 editorial rows keep their existing flight/varietal data.

**Schema changes:** (migration `20260415000001_pipeline_simplification.sql`)
- [x] Migration: drop `NOT NULL` on `wineries.ava_primary`, `wineries.reservation_type`. Mapper defaults null region to `''` and null reservation_type to `'walk_ins_welcome'` so the UI doesn't break on discovered-but-unreviewed rows.
- [x] Migration: drop `winery_registry` table + its indexes + `trg_winery_registry_updated_at` trigger.
- [x] Migration: add `osm_type` text + `osm_id` bigint to `wineries` with a partial unique index `uidx_wineries_osm_identity` (only constrains rows where both are set) — makes discovery upserts idempotent.
- [x] Migration: drop the `'editorial_excel'` default on `wineries.data_source`. Existing 68 rows keep their value; discovery sets `'osm_auto'` explicitly.
- [ ] Apply the migration against the remote Supabase project (`supabase db push` or dashboard). Re-run `pnpm db:gen-types` after apply to refresh `src/lib/database.types.ts` from the real schema (currently hand-edited to match).

**Discovery rewrite (`scripts/discover-osm.ts`):** ✅
- [x] Replace `winery_registry.upsert` with direct writes to `wineries`. Three buckets per run: already-linked (update minimal fields), fuzzy-matched (stamp osm_type/osm_id onto existing editorial row), new (insert minimal row).
- [x] Populate from OSM tags: `name`, `slug` (kebab-case with collision suffix), `latitude`, `longitude`, `website_url`, `phone`, `address_street/city`, `osm_type`, `osm_id`. Leave editorial fields null.
- [x] Keep the dedup logic from `src/lib/pipeline/dedup.ts`.
- [x] Log per-bucket counts in dry-run output so you can see what a live run would do before pulling the trigger.

**CSV import retirement:**
- [x] Delete `scripts/import-wineries.ts`. (Also deleted the now-dead helpers in `scripts/lib/`: `parse-csv.ts`, `transforms.ts`, `validate.ts`.)
- [x] Delete `docs/csv/*.csv` (8 files) and `docs/sonoma-winery-database-complete.xlsx`.
- [x] Remove the `db:import` / `db:import:dry` npm scripts from `package.json`. Also removed `db:reset` since it chained into `db:import`.
- [x] The existing 68 `wineries` rows stay in the DB — no data wiped.

**Admin UI — manual fill-in layer:**
- [ ] **Delete action** on `/admin/wineries/[id]` — confirmation modal, cascades to `flights`, `winery_varietals`, `content_drafts`, `winery_scrapes`, `winery_snapshots`.
- [ ] **AVA assignment** — required dropdown on the edit form (primary + optional secondary). A discovered winery with null `ava_primary` should be flagged on the admin dashboard as "needs AVA."
- [ ] **Flights editor** — CRUD for `flights` rows per winery (name, price, duration, wines included, format, food pairing, description).
- [ ] **Varietals editor** — multi-select of varietal enum with per-row `is_signature` flag.
- [ ] **Style scores editor** — six sliders (1-5) for `style_*` columns, with a "not set" / null state distinct from "3."
- [ ] **Editorial content** — `tagline`, `description`, `unique_selling_point`, `best_for` text fields.
- [ ] **Data source badge** — surface `data_source` and `last_verified_at` prominently so admin can tell editorial vs. auto-discovered at a glance.

**Final pipeline flow:**

```
discover  (OSM → wineries directly, minimal fields)
  → crawl    (Firecrawl → winery_scrapes)
  → extract  (Claude → content_drafts: hours, amenities, phone, address, reservation_type)
  → places   (Google Places → content_drafts: rating_google, review_count_total)
  → publish  (auto-approve factual high-confidence → wineries; rest → admin review queue)
```

One command: `pnpm pipeline:run`. No `winery_registry`, no editorial CSV, no LLM enrichment. Admin panel fills in what the pipeline can't (flights, varietals, style scores, AVA, tagline, description).

**Order of operations (suggested):**
1. Schema migrations (nullable + drop registry) — reversible, doesn't break anything immediately since registry is only touched by `discover-osm.ts`.
2. Rewrite discovery script.
3. Dry-run discovery against production to see what OSM finds and how many dedup against the 68.
4. Build admin delete + AVA assignment UI (blockers for adopting discovery output).
5. Delete CSV import + CSV files.
6. Run full pipeline end-to-end.
7. Build remaining admin editors (flights, varietals, style scores, editorial) incrementally.

### Hours & Ratings — Run Existing Pipeline + Add Places Stage

All 68 wineries currently show hours and ratings from the one-time editorial CSV import (`docs/csv/tasting-and-hours.csv`, `docs/csv/ratings.csv`). The `rating_google` column is a misnomer — nothing in the codebase ever calls the Google API; the values are hand-entered. The pipeline we've already built can handle both accurately with one new stage.

**Hours (already wired — just never been run against production):**
- [ ] **Run the pipeline end-to-end.** Discovery is complete (68 wineries in DB), so start at crawl. Dry-run first: `pnpm pipeline:run --dry-run --skip=discovery`. Then live: `pnpm pipeline:run --skip=discovery`. Firecrawl scrapes each site, Claude extracts hours into `content_drafts`, publish auto-approves factual high-confidence fields per `src/lib/pipeline/publish.ts:57` (hours is `affectsMatching: false`, threshold 0.9 in `AUTO_APPROVE_HIGH_CONFIDENCE`).
- [ ] **Spot-check published hours** against 3-5 winery websites to confirm accuracy before fully trusting the auto-approve path. Anything not auto-approved will land in the admin review queue.

**Ratings — new `places` stage:**
- [ ] **Add `google_place_id` column** via migration (`supabase/migrations/`).
- [ ] **New stage: `scripts/places-sync.ts` + lib `src/lib/pipeline/places.ts`.** For each winery: resolve `place_id` via Places `findPlaceFromText` using `name + address_city` (cache to the new column), then fetch Place Details for `rating` + `user_ratings_total`. Write proposals to `content_drafts` — same table, same review UX as extract-stage drafts.
- [ ] **Register `rating_google` and `review_count_total` in `DRAFT_FIELDS`** (`src/lib/pipeline/publish.ts:49`). Both `factual`, `affectsMatching: false` — let high-confidence (exact Places API response) auto-approve, no human gate needed for numeric ratings.
- [ ] **Wire the new stage into `scripts/run-pipeline.ts`** so a single `pnpm pipeline:run` covers discover → crawl → extract → places → publish.
- [ ] **Stamp `last_verified_at`** on every winery the places stage touches so the UI can surface freshness.
- [ ] **Env + ToS:** add `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` to `.env.example` + Vercel envs; attribute "Google" in the UI near the star display; don't store raw review text; refresh no more than every ~30 days per winery.

**Admin review (the manual-verification layer):**
- The existing admin "Review Queue" spec (see `### 3. Review Queue`) already handles this — once ratings land in `content_drafts`, the same UI that reviews hours/phones/amenities covers rating proposals too. No new admin work needed beyond what's already planned.

**Cleanup once wired:**
- [x] Remove the stale "Google Places Sync" entry from `## Future` — replaced by the concrete plan above.
- [ ] Either hide the star row in `src/app/wineries/[slug]/page.tsx:276-290` until the first places-sync run lands, or accept that the editorial values stand in until then. Decision point for before we share more widely.

### Supabase Development Environment

Set up a safe local/dev workflow so we can develop, create itineraries, tweak data, and experiment without touching production. Options to evaluate:

- [ ] **Option A — Separate Supabase project:** Create a second Supabase project (e.g. `sonoma-sip-dev`) with its own database, auth, and API keys. Seed it with production data via `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` or the import pipeline. Vercel preview deployments and local dev use the dev project's keys; production uses the prod project's keys.
- [ ] **Option B — Supabase branching:** Use [Supabase Branching](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/branching) (if available on the plan) to get ephemeral database branches tied to Git branches. Migrations and seed data apply automatically per branch.
- [ ] **Option C — Local Supabase (Docker):** Run `supabase start` locally for a fully local Postgres + Auth + API stack. No risk to production at all. Requires Docker. Good for schema iteration but won't test Supabase-hosted features (edge functions, storage CDN, etc.).

**Regardless of option chosen:**
- [ ] Document the chosen approach in this file and `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Update `.env.example` with dev vs. prod variable guidance
- [ ] Ensure `vercel env` has separate values for preview vs. production environments
- [ ] Add seed/import script that populates the dev database with representative data
- [ ] Verify local `pnpm dev` works against the dev database end-to-end (quiz → results → plan creation)

### UI — Mobile Fixes

- [x] **Remove "Get Started" button from quiz page.** The user is already on the quiz — the CTA at the bottom is redundant. Remove or replace with something contextually useful.
- [x] **Results/Plan page — map overflow on mobile.** On both the results and shared plan pages, the map spills outside its container on iPhone-width screens. Fix: constrain the map to the container width, add proper `border-radius`, and ensure no horizontal overflow. Unified both pages to use a shared `MapSection` component.
- [x] **Results page — bottom border-radius clipping.** The bottom corners of the results card/container are being cut off on mobile. Fix the `overflow` / `border-radius` interaction so corners render fully.
- [ ] **Mobile navigation overhaul.** The current navbar/menu doesn't look good on mobile. Redesign using the `/ui` skill and ui.sh picker workflow — generate multiple variants (e.g. slide-out drawer, bottom sheet, hamburger menu) and pick the best one in-browser. Ensure the nav works well across all mobile pages (landing, quiz, results, plan).
- [x] **Winery detail page — text alignment on mobile.** Some text on the winery detail page is incorrectly centered on mobile viewports. Should be left-aligned to match the rest of the content flow.

### Winery Detail Page — Distance-Based Nearby Suggestions

The "Nearby Wineries" section on `/wineries/[slug]` currently filters by same AVA region and takes the first 3. We already have `latitude` and `longitude` for all 68 wineries — use them for real proximity.

**Heuristic:**
- **≤ 5 miles = "nearby."** In Sonoma, most AVAs are compact (Dry Creek Valley ~8 mi long, Russian River Valley ~12 mi). A 5-mile radius captures wineries along the same road/corridor — roughly a 10-minute drive on two-lane wine country roads. Beyond 5 miles you're typically crossing into a different area and it stops feeling close.
- **Fallback:** If fewer than 3 wineries fall within 5 miles, backfill with same-region wineries so the section is never empty.

**Implementation:**
- [x] **Add a `haversineDistance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)` utility** in `src/lib/` that returns distance in miles between two coordinates. (`src/lib/geo.ts`)
- [x] **Update `/wineries/[slug]` page** to compute distance from the current winery to all others, filter to ≤ 5 mi, and sort closest-first. Fall back to same-region if fewer than 3 results. (Thresholds extracted to `NEARBY_RADIUS_MILES = 5` / `NEARBY_MIN_RESULTS = 3` consts at the top of the file so they're easy to tune.)
- [x] **Show distance in the UI** — display something like "2.3 mi away" on each nearby winery card so users can judge proximity at a glance.
- [x] **Consider the 5-mile threshold after real data review** — spot-checked wineries in dense areas (Healdsburg, Glen Ellen) and sparse areas; the 5-mile radius feels right. No adjustment needed.

### OG Image for Deep Links (Plan Sharing)

When sharing the home page, the OG preview looks good. But sharing a plan page (`/plan/[id]`) shows the raw URL as text instead of a rich preview. The plan page has OG `title` and `description` metadata but is **missing `og:image`**.

- [ ] **Add a default OG image for plan pages.** At minimum, set a static fallback `og:image` in the plan page's `generateMetadata` so every shared link gets a branded preview card instead of raw URL text. Use the same OG image as the home page as a starting point.
- [x] **Consider dynamic OG images (stretch).** Use Next.js `opengraph-image.tsx` (or Vercel OG / `@vercel/og`) to generate a dynamic image per plan — e.g. showing the plan title, number of stops, and winery names. This makes each shared link unique and more compelling. (`src/app/plan/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx` now fetches the real plan from Supabase via shared `getPlan` helper in `src/lib/plan.ts`; falls back to generic branding if the plan is missing.)
- [x] **Verify OG tags on all shareable routes.** Audit `/`, `/results`, `/plan/[id]`, and `/wineries/[slug]` to ensure every page that can be shared has proper `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, and `og:url`. Test with the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator).
  - `/` — root layout defines `openGraph` + `twitter`, root `opengraph-image.tsx` convention auto-attaches. ✓
  - `/plan/[id]` — wired up in earlier commits (metadata reference + dynamic OG image). ✓
  - `/wineries/[slug]` — previously defined `openGraph`/`twitter` without `images`. Added `images` and `siteName` to both, and added `src/app/wineries/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` so each winery gets a dynamic OG image rendering name + region + city + tagline + price range + signature varietals. ✓
  - `/wineries` — previously inherited root OG verbatim. Now defines per-page `openGraph`/`twitter` with the browse-specific title/description + root OG image. ✓
  - `/results` — `robots: { index: false }` and shows session-local data, so shared links aren't meaningful anyway. Inherits root OG for the rare case someone does share. ✓
  - Manual validation with Facebook Sharing Debugger / Twitter Card Validator confirmed against the deployed URL. ✓

## Data Pipeline

### The Plan

Simple: **discover wineries (OSM) → scrape their websites (Firecrawl) → extract structured data (Claude) → review & edit in admin UI → publish to database**.

No association scraping, no LLM-generated editorial, no multi-source merging. OSM gives us names, coordinates, and website URLs for Sonoma County wineries. Firecrawl scrapes each winery's own website for hours, contact info, amenities, etc. Humans do the editorial work (taglines, descriptions, style scores) through the admin panel.

### Pipeline Cleanup

Remove retired code that's no longer needed:

- [ ] Delete `scripts/enrich-wineries.ts` — LLM editorial generation replaced by manual editing in admin. **⚠ Deferred: still subprocess-spawned by `scripts/run-pipeline.ts` (the orchestrator). Deleting it without touching the orchestrator would leave `pnpm pipeline:run` broken at runtime when it hits the enrich stage. Two ways to clean up:**
  - **(a) Surgical removal:** in `scripts/run-pipeline.ts`, drop `'enrich'` from the `StageName` union (~line 40), the `STAGES` array entry (~lines 76-83), the `valid` set in `splitStageList` (~line 137), and the doc comments at the top (~lines 6, 16, 19, 20). Then delete the two enrich files. ~20-line edit + 2 deletions.
  - **(b) Pair with the bigger rewrite below:** do this as part of "Simplify `scripts/run-pipeline.ts`" since that task already involves rewriting the stage list. Cleaner if you're going to rewrite that file anyway.
- [ ] Delete `src/lib/pipeline/enrich.ts` — enrichment library (473 lines). Same dependency note as above — only imported by `scripts/enrich-wineries.ts`, so it goes in the same commit.
- [x] Delete `scripts/discover-associations.ts` — association HTML scraping (368 lines)
- [x] Delete `src/lib/pipeline/associations.ts` — association parsing library (198 lines)
- [x] Delete `src/lib/pipeline/associations.test.ts` — association tests (203 lines)
- [x] Delete `scripts/merge-discoveries.ts` — multi-source merge, not needed with OSM only (154 lines)
- [x] Delete `scripts/validate-coordinates.ts` — one-time utility, already served its purpose (457 lines)
- [ ] Simplify `scripts/run-pipeline.ts` — replace 336-line subprocess spawner with a simple script that runs: discover → crawl → extract → publish. **Pair this with the enrich deletion above (option b).**
- [x] Remove npm scripts from `package.json`: `pipeline:enrich`, `pipeline:enrich:dry`, `discover:associations`, `discover:associations:dry`, `discover:merge`, `discover:merge:promote`

### What Stays

| Stage | Script | Library | What it does |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Discover | `scripts/discover-osm.ts` | `src/lib/pipeline/dedup.ts` | Query OSM Overpass API for wineries in Sonoma County. Returns names, coordinates, websites. Dedup against existing DB. |
| Crawl | `scripts/crawl-wineries.ts` | `src/lib/pipeline/crawl.ts` | Firecrawl scrapes up to 5 pages per winery website. Stores markdown in `winery_scrapes`. |
| Extract | `scripts/extract-wineries.ts` | `src/lib/pipeline/extract.ts` | Claude Haiku extracts structured fields (phone, address, hours, amenities) with confidence scores. Writes proposals to `content_drafts`. |
| Publish | `scripts/publish-wineries.ts` | `src/lib/pipeline/publish.ts` | Auto-approves high-confidence factual fields, applies approved drafts to `wineries` table, snapshots before overwriting. |
| Support | — | `src/lib/pipeline/diff.ts` | Change detection: compares extracted values to current DB, only creates drafts for meaningful differences. |
| Support | — | `src/lib/pipeline/tracking.ts` | Audit trail: records each pipeline run (stage, status, duration, errors) in `pipeline_runs`. |

All scripts support `--dry-run`, `--winery=slug`, `--tier=`, `--limit=`, `--force`.

### Pipeline Improvements

- [ ] **Maximize OSM coverage** — review the Overpass query to ensure we're catching all winery types (`amenity=winery`, `craft=winery`, `tourism=wine_cellar`, `shop=wine`). Goal: discover as many Sonoma County wineries as possible from this single source.
- [ ] **Scheduling** — set up Vercel cron or GitHub Actions: discovery monthly, crawl weekly for editorial tier, monthly for others
- [ ] **URL health checks** — weekly HEAD request to every `website_url` and `booking_url`, store in `url_health_checks` table (already exists in schema)

---

## Admin Panel

_The primary interface for managing winery data. This is where the real quality work happens — reviewing pipeline output, editing wineries directly, writing editorial content._

### 1. Auth & Shell

- [ ] Password-protected `/admin/*` route group — env var `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, cookie-based session
- [ ] Login page at `/admin` — single password field, no user accounts needed
- [ ] Admin layout with sidebar nav: Dashboard, Review, Wineries, Pipeline, Health

### 2. Dashboard (`/admin`)

- [ ] Pending drafts count (link to review queue)
- [ ] Last pipeline run per stage with status and timestamp
- [ ] Coverage breakdown: editorial / verified / discovered counts

### 3. Review Queue (`/admin/review`)

The pipeline writes proposals to `content_drafts` with `status='pending'`. This is where humans approve, reject, or edit them.

- [ ] **Queue view** — pending drafts grouped by winery, editorial tier wineries first
- [ ] **Filters** — by field type (factual / experience flag), confidence level, winery search
- [ ] **Winery review page** — all pending drafts for one winery on a single page
- [ ] **Diff display** — current value vs proposed value, confidence badge, expandable source quote
- [ ] **Actions** — Approve / Reject (with note) / Edit & Approve per draft
- [ ] **Bulk approve** — "Approve all high-confidence factual" / "Approve all for this winery"
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** — A=approve, E=edit, R=reject, N=next
- [ ] **Progress** — "12 of 45 wineries reviewed" with percentage

### 4. Winery Editor (`/admin/wineries`)

Direct editing — for adding wineries OSM missed, fixing typos, writing editorial content (taglines, descriptions, style scores).

- [ ] **Winery list** — searchable, filterable by coverage tier, sortable by name/updated
- [ ] **Edit form** — all winery fields: contact info, hours, amenities, experience flags, editorial content, style scores
- [ ] **Add winery** — manually create a new winery (for ones not in OSM)
- [ ] **Change history** — link to snapshots for this winery

### 5. Pipeline Runs (`/admin/pipeline`)

- [ ] **Run history table** — stage, status, duration, wineries processed/failed
- [ ] **Run detail** — expand to see per-winery results and error messages
- [ ] **Scrape viewer** — read-only markdown of `winery_scrapes` for debugging extraction issues
- [ ] **Manual trigger** — kick off discovery, crawl, or extract for a specific winery or tier

### 6. Data Health (`/admin/health`)

- [ ] **Missing fields** — wineries missing critical data (coordinates, website, region)
- [ ] **Stale data** — wineries not verified in >90 days
- [ ] **Broken URLs** — 404s and redirects from `url_health_checks`
- [ ] **Coverage overview** — counts by tier with drill-down

### 7. Rollback

- [ ] **Snapshot timeline** per winery from `winery_snapshots`
- [ ] **Snapshot diff** — compare any snapshot to current data
- [ ] **Revert** — restore a snapshot to the `wineries` row (creates its own snapshot first so you can undo)

---

## Deploy to Vercel — Step by Step

_Get this in front of coworkers for real product feedback. The app is production-ready — every page works with real Supabase data._

### Prerequisites

You already have:

- [x] Supabase project (ref: `rxihebhphpbhzanijfuv`, region: us-east-2)
- [x] Database with all migrations applied and 68 wineries imported
- [x] Mapbox account with custom "Dawn Wine Country" style
- [ ] Vercel account (free tier is fine — 100GB bandwidth/mo)

### Step 1: Connect repo to Vercel

```bash
# Option A: Vercel CLI (recommended)
pnpm add -g vercel
vercel login
vercel link                    # Follow prompts to create/link project
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL        # Paste your Supabase URL
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY   # Paste your anon key
vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY       # Paste your service role key (secret)
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN        # Paste your Mapbox public token
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL            # Your production URL (e.g., https://sonomasip.vercel.app)

# Option B: Vercel Dashboard
# 1. Go to vercel.com/new
# 2. Import your GitHub repo
# 3. Set environment variables in the dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables)
```

### Step 2: Environment variables

| Variable                        | Where to find it                                          | Required                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API → Project URL         | Yes                              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API → `anon` `public` key | Yes                              |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Supabase dashboard → Settings → API → `service_role` key  | Yes                              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`      | Mapbox dashboard → Access tokens                          | Yes (for maps)                   |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`          | Your Vercel deployment URL                                | Optional (defaults to localhost) |

### Step 3: Verify build locally

```bash
pnpm build          # Should complete with no errors
pnpm start          # Test production server at localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Deploy

```bash
vercel --prod        # Deploy to production

# Or just push to main — Vercel auto-deploys on push if connected via dashboard
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Post-deploy smoke test

- [x] Home page loads, hero renders, CTA works
- [x] Quiz: complete all 4 steps → results page shows real wineries with scores
- [x] Results: map renders with pins, share button creates a plan URL
- [x] Plan page: shared URL loads the saved itinerary
- [x] Browse: `/wineries` shows all 68 wineries with working filters
- [x] Detail: click any winery → detail page with flights, hours, amenities
- [x] Legal: `/terms` and `/privacy` pages render

### Step 6: Share with coworkers

Share the Vercel URL. Ask them to:

1. Take the quiz with real preferences
2. Review their results — do the recommendations feel right?
3. Try the "Create Your Plan" flow
4. Browse wineries and check detail pages
5. Note anything that feels off, confusing, or broken

### Post-deploy hardening (do after initial feedback)

- [ ] Restrict Mapbox token to your Vercel domain(s) via Mapbox dashboard → Token restrictions
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your actual production URL
- [ ] Verify Supabase RLS works in production (anon key can't write to wineries)

---

## SEO & Performance

- [x] `metadata` export on every winery page (title, description, OG)
- [x] JSON-LD structured data (`Winery` / `TouristAttraction`) where info is accurate
- [x] `sitemap.xml` from `getAllWinerySlugs()` + static pages
- [x] `robots.txt` (allow all, sitemap reference)
- [ ] `next/image` for any winery photos (if added)
- [ ] Lighthouse-driven fixes (LCP, font loading, CLS)

---

## Analytics

- [ ] Plausible snippet / proxy per their Next.js guidance
- [ ] Events: `quiz_started`, `quiz_step_completed`, `quiz_completed`, `results_rendered`, `winery_detail_opened`, `share_created`, `pdf_downloaded`, `email_sent`
- [ ] Funnel visualization: quiz start → completion → share

---

## Future

_After admin panel and core pipeline are solid._

### Observability (Sentry)
- [ ] `@sentry/nextjs` for client + server error tracking
- [ ] `@sentry/node` for pipeline script instrumentation
- [ ] Alerts on pipeline failures and error spikes

### Click Attribution
- [ ] Track "Book a Tasting" clicks via `navigator.sendBeacon`
- [ ] Append `?ref=sonomasip` to outbound booking URLs
- [ ] Click analytics in admin panel

### Kill Switches (env vars)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_MAP=true` — static image instead of Mapbox GL
- [ ] `DISABLE_EMAIL=true` — disable email share
- [ ] `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` — disable all writes, site stays browsable

### Bot Protection
- [ ] `navigator.webdriver` check before mounting map; bots get static placeholder
- [ ] Honeypot fields on quiz and email forms

### Geographic Expansion
- [ ] Add Napa Valley AVA regions to `ava_region` enum
- [ ] Update app copy from "Sonoma" to "Sonoma & Napa"

## What's been built (completed work)

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 0 — Spec & Design</strong> ✅</summary>

Repo, tooling, Prettier/ESLint, `.env.example`, route list, legal copy (terms, privacy, disclaimers on every data page), design system (fonts, color tokens, WCAG AA), shadcn/ui installed with full Sonoma palette mapped to semantic tokens.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 3 — Next.js Foundation</strong> ✅</summary>

App Router bootstrap, absolute imports, Tailwind, root layout, `env.ts` with Zod validation, dynamic favicon/OG images, PWA manifest, route-level loading skeletons.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 3.5 — UI Prototype</strong> ✅</summary>

All screens built and polished with real data: landing page (hero, how it works, features grid, featured wineries, CTA), quiz (4-step flow with progress bar, session persistence, animations), results (score rings, map with fly-to, share/print/email actions, empty/error states), winery detail (two-column layout, flights, hours, amenities, nearby wineries), browse/directory (filter sidebar, sort, 3-column grid), shared plan (itinerary with numbered stops, map, disclaimer), Mapbox (custom "Dawn Wine Country" style, lazy-loaded, interactive markers/popups).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase D1–D5 — Schema, Data Quality, Import Pipeline</strong> ✅</summary>

Schema: 7 migrations applied (enums, wineries, flights, varietals, shared_itineraries, health checks, field overrides). RLS on all tables. Import pipeline: `scripts/import-wineries.ts` parses 8 CSV sheets, validates, upserts. 68 wineries, 118 flights, 344 varietals. Types generated from Supabase + mapper layer. Coordinates validated for all 68 wineries.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase D6 — Matching Engine</strong> ✅</summary>

Filters, scoring, explanations, orchestrator, progressive filter relaxation, 44 unit tests, 7 golden file profiles (55 assertions against real Supabase data). `pnpm test:golden` to run.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase D7 — Wire Up (Mock → Real Data)</strong> ✅</summary>

All pages wired to Supabase: quiz submit → server action → matching engine → results. Winery detail/browse pages use real data. Share flow saves to `shared_itineraries` table. ISR caching on winery pages (hourly revalidation).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Rate Limiting</strong> ✅</summary>

In-memory token bucket (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`), applied to quiz submit (10/hr) and plan create (5/hr), 429 + Retry-After responses, global middleware 60 req/min per IP (`src/middleware.ts`).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Data Pipeline — CLI & Engine</strong> ✅</summary>

Full ETL pipeline built as CLI scripts with library modules. Discovery (OSM Overpass API), crawl (Firecrawl, 5 pages/winery), extract (Claude Haiku with confidence scores), publish (auto-approve + manual review + snapshots). Orchestrator runs all stages. 7 pipeline DB tables with RLS. 3 test suites. All scripts support `--dry-run` and common filters.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Data Pipeline — Retired Code</strong></summary>

The following was built but is being retired in favor of a simpler pipeline + admin UI:

- **Association discovery** (`scripts/discover-associations.ts`, `src/lib/pipeline/associations.ts`, `associations.test.ts`) — 769 lines. Scraped Sonoma Vintners + Wine Road HTML directories. Fragile (bot challenges, HTML changes). OSM provides better coverage with zero fragility.
- **LLM enrichment** (`scripts/enrich-wineries.ts`, `src/lib/pipeline/enrich.ts`) — 882 lines. Claude Sonnet auto-generated taglines, descriptions, style scores, editorial judgments. Replaced by manual editing in admin panel — humans write better editorial content.
- **Merge discoveries** (`scripts/merge-discoveries.ts`) — 154 lines. Cross-source dedup and promotion. Not needed with single OSM discovery source.
- **Pipeline orchestrator** (`scripts/run-pipeline.ts`) — 336 lines. Over-engineered subprocess spawner with flag forwarding. Being simplified.
- **Coordinate validator** (`scripts/validate-coordinates.ts`) — 457 lines. One-time utility that already served its purpose during initial data import.
